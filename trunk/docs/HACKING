General:

* docs/* exists for a reason, especially docs/CHANGELOG
* Quote correctly
* Variable names should be descriptive
* Reference variables as ${variablename}
* "printf --" unless you have reason not to
* Avoid unnecessary cats, never use two commands if one will do
* No unnecessary new lines, the only blocks should be those
  introduced by code: if/then/else/fi etc

lib/misc/*:


* Code in here is meant to be ported to new platforms
* OS specific code should be minimised
* Minimise changes to the APIs used by lib/checks/*
* Don't read _ if there's a chance the data may be useful later

lib/checks/*:

* Code in here is meant to be portable, it should inherit new
  capabilities by way of changes to lib/misc/*
* Avoid OS specific code, the APIs should fail sane
