General:

* docs/* exists for a reason, especially docs/CHANGELOG
* Quote correctly
* Variable names should be descriptive
* Reference variables as ${variablename}
* "printf --" unless you have reason not to
* Avoid unnecessary cats, never use two commands if one will do

lib/misc:

* OS specific code should be minimised
* Minimise changes to the APIs used by lib/checks/*
* Don't read _ if there's a chance the data may be useful later

lib/checks:

* Avoid OS specific code, the APIs should fail sane
